Website Vulnerability Report for r3vl.xyz

Overview
This report presents a thorough vulnerability assessment of the website r3vl.xyz, conducted using multiple security testing tools such as OWASP ZAP, Nmap, and manual inspection. Our goal is to identify potential security risks and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate them and improve the overall security posture of the website.

Tools Used
OWASP ZAP: For scanning, spidering, fuzzing, and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
Nmap: For network scanning and service detection.
Manual Testing: For hands-on inspection of the site's response to common security configurations.

Identified Vulnerabilities
1. Missing Critical Security Headers
Description: The site lacks several critical HTTP security headers, which leaves it open to a variety of attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and referrer data leakage.

Details:

Content-Security-Policy: Missing. This header helps mitigate XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.
X-Frame-Options: Missing. This header protects the website from clickjacking attacks.
Referrer-Policy: Missing. This header helps control what referrer information is shared when navigating away from the website.
Permissions-Policy: Missing. This header manages access to features such as the camera, microphone, and geolocation.
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Configured incorrectly with a low max-age value, which may allow attackers to perform downgrade attacks.
Impact: The absence of these headers makes the website susceptible to several attacks, including XSS, clickjacking, and possible data leaks.

Recommendation:

Content-Security-Policy: Implement a robust content security policy:

default-src 'self';
script-src 'self';
object-src 'none'.
X-Frame-Options: Prevent clickjacking by using:

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN.
Referrer-Policy: Limit the amount of referrer data sent:

Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade.
Permissions-Policy: Restrict features such as:

camera=(),
microphone=(),
geolocation=().
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):

Increase the max-age value to: max-age=31536000;
Ensure it includes all subdomains: includeSubDomains.
Open Ports Detected:
Multiple open ports were detected during the Nmap scan, which exposes the website to potential attacks.

2. Open Ports Detected
Description: Multiple open ports were detected during the Nmap scan, which exposes the website to potential attacks.

Details:

Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted traffic.
Port 443 (HTTPS): Encrypted traffic, but requires additional hardening.
Port 8080 (HTTP): Potential development or admin access.
Impact: Unencrypted traffic over port 80 allows data to be transmitted in clear text, making it susceptible to interception. Port 8080, commonly used for administrative purposes, could present a security risk if not properly secured.

Recommendation:

Redirect all traffic from port 80 to port 443 to enforce encryption.
Port 8080: Secure it with strong access controls or close it if not needed for public use.
3. Cloudflare Misconfiguration
Description: The website uses Cloudflare for security and traffic management, but some SSL/TLS configurations may expose sensitive metadata, such as certificate randomness not representing time correctly.

Impact: Improper SSL/TLS configuration can expose traffic to man-in-the-middle attacks or allow attackers to extract sensitive metadata from HTTP headers.

Recommendation:

Review the SSL/TLS configuration on Cloudflare and ensure it follows best practices, such as enabling full (strict) SSL and configuring secure cipher suites.
4. Potential Cloud Metadata Exposure
Description: The NGINX server is misconfigured, potentially exposing cloud metadata from services like AWS or GCP through public IP ranges (e.g., 169.254.169.254).

Impact: Exposing metadata endpoints can allow attackers to retrieve sensitive instance data, potentially leading to full system compromise.

Recommendation:

Update NGINX configurations to block access to internal metadata IP ranges from external sources.
5. Outdated TLS Version
Description: The website supports TLS versions that are outdated and considered insecure (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).

Impact: Older versions of TLS have known vulnerabilities such as POODLE and BEAST, making the website susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.

Recommendation:
Disable support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and enforce the use of TLS 1.2 or newer
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;

Vulnerability Summary Table
Vulnerability	Risk Level	Recommendation
Missing Security Headers	High	Implement missing headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
Open Ports Detected	Medium	Enforce HTTPS and restrict access to port 8080
Cloudflare Misconfiguration	Medium	Review SSL/TLS settings on Cloudflare
Cloud Metadata Exposure	Critical	Block metadata IP ranges from external access
Outdated TLS Version	High	Upgrade to TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only

Conclusion
The website r3vl.xyz has been found to have several security vulnerabilities, ranging from missing security headers to potential cloud metadata exposure. Immediate remediation of these issues is critical to improving the website's security and reducing the risk of exploitation.

Recommendations Summary:

Implement critical security headers.
Enforce HTTPS by redirecting all traffic from port 80 to 443.
Review Cloudflare's SSL/TLS settings and ensure proper SSL configuration.
Prevent access to cloud metadata from the public internet.
Disable outdated versions of TLS and enforce stronger cryptographic protocols.
